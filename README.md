# pjsv (package json semantic versioner)

organize your package.json's version from the command line ðŸ’»

### motivation

whenever I work on a specific project, I tend to forget to update my package.json's version so I automated the entire process so that whenever I build and push to the server, the package.json's version is always up to date

### what is semantic versioning ?

each project has a version which consist of three important stages: major, minor, patch

major is when you make incompatible changes that cannot be backwards compatible

minor is when you add a functionality or feature that offers it in a backwards compatible way

patch is when you do bug fixes that is backwards compatible

```
a typical version will look like this: major.minor.patch

example: 1.2.5 (which is the first major release, 2 added functionalities on top of the original release, 5 bug fixes)
```

you can read more about semantic versioning [here](https://semver.org/)

### installation

It is ideal to install it as a dev dependency in your project
`npm install pjsv -D`

and you can use npx if you don't want to install it in your project
`npx pjsv upgrade` or `npx pjsv downgrade`

and last but not least, you can install it globally but it is the least recommended method since not all developers upgrade their global npm packages, either use it as a dev dependency in your project or use npx
`npm install pjsv -g`

### commands

pjsv has two commands

`pjsv upgrade` which prompts you to upgrade your package.json based on your current stage (major/minor/patch)

`pjsv downgrade` which prompts you to downgrade your package.json based on your current stage

#### why there is a downgrade command ?

all though you will be using git to manage your project's version but it is there incase you have to downgrade your package.json's version. Ideally you will revert back to a specific git commit and continue from there.

### best practice

I would highly recommend to use [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) along with pjsv

in your package.json:

```
"husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "pjsv upgrade",
    }
  }
```

using Husky on the pre-commit command, pjsv will always be executed before commiting a message to your changes

### documentation

the entire codebase is documented using [typedoc](https://typedoc.org/) so all you have to do is pull the project from github and run the `doc` command

```
npm run doc
```

it will create a doc folder that contains all of the information needed

### compilation

if you pulled the project and wanted to compile your changes, run the `compile` command

```
npm run compile
```

then to test your changes, the project uses [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) and [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node)

```
npm run dev:upgrade  // test out the upgrade command
npm run dev:downgrade // test out the downgrade command
```
